This is a C(T) experiment being done in Physics 350.
It records the decay response of an RC circuit where the capacitance is a strong function of temperature.

Start temp = 20.000000
Temp step = 5.000000
End temp = 70.000000
Num temps = 5
Num avg cycles = 30
Num points per meas = 1000
Meas time interval = 1.000000E-5
