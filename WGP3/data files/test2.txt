This is a C(T) experiment being done in Physics 350.
It records the decay response of an RC circuit where the capacitance is a strong function of temperature.

Start temp = 3.000000
Temp step = 3.000000
End temp = 3.000000
Num temps = 5
Num avg cycles = 3
Num points per meas = 3
Meas time interval = 3.000000E+0
